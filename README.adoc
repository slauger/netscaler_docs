Best practices and example configurations for Citrix NetScaler.

== Intro

=== What's this?

In this documents i will share all my NetScaler best practices and guidelines.

This is not a "no-brainer" copy & paste guide. Double check every configuration line before
you paste it in your NetScaler.

Custom configurations (like binding of ssl certificates) are not part of this document.
